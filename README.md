This is another project created using JavaScript, HTML and CSS. It was created as part of [TheOdinProject](https://www.theodinproject.com/) curriculum.

## Lessons Learned

This was a very difficult project. There was a lot of fixing issues and breaking other things at first but eventually got everything working smoothly. Learned a lot more about DOM manipulation by adding keyboard support. I think ive also cleaned up my javascript code a lot since my last 2 projects. Overall very happy with how it turned out, and feel like my overall knowledge improved a lot off this project.
